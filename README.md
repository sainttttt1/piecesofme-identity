  <h1>üèà Football Fan (Joey Bosa)</h1>
  <p>I‚Äôve always loved football ‚Äì the energy, the discipline, and the teamwork. Joey Bosa is my favorite player because of his intensity and strategic play. Football taught me how important collaboration and focus are ‚Äî which I believe is crucial in coding too.</p>
  <p><strong>Connection to CS:</strong> In computer science, especially in large projects, working like a team on the field is essential. Algorithms are like playbooks, and everyone has to execute their role.</p>

  <h2>üåü What We Have in Common</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Annie Easley loved solving problems ‚Äî I also enjoy exploring how things work, whether it‚Äôs in football strategy, finance, or technology.</li>
    <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Like her, I believe in pushing forward even when things are hard ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs on the field, in code, or in life.</li>
    <li><strong>Multidimensional Identity:</strong> Annie didn‚Äôt limit herself to just being a scientist ‚Äî she had many sides. I also see myself as more than a student: I‚Äôm an athlete, fashion lover, foodie, and more.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚öñÔ∏è How We‚Äôre Different</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Time Period:</strong> Annie worked in a time with much more discrimination and fewer opportunities. I have access to modern tools, online learning, and more support.</li>
    <li><strong>Field of Focus:</strong> She focused on aerospace and energy programs ‚Äî I‚Äôm more interested in finance tech, user interface, and creative applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Background:</strong> Annie‚Äôs motivation came partly from overcoming racial and gender barriers. My motivations are more rooted in personal interests like football, creativity, and tech-driven goals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üí¨ Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>Understanding people like Annie Easley helps me realize how identity impacts opportunity and perspective. While our stories are different, her legacy helps me think about how I can use my own identity to bring something unique to computer science ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs teamwork from football or creativity from fashion.</p>
