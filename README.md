  <h2>🏈 Football Fan (Joey Bosa)</h2>
  <p>I’ve always loved football – the energy, the discipline, and the teamwork. Joey Bosa is my favorite player because of his intensity and strategic play. Football taught me how important collaboration and focus are — which I believe is crucial in coding too.</p>
  <p><strong>Connection to CS:</strong> In computer science, especially in large projects, working like a team on the field is essential. Algorithms are like playbooks, and everyone has to execute their role.</p>

  <h2>❄️ Love for Winter</h2>
  <p>Winter is my favorite season. I love the stillness, the cold air, and how everything slows down. I often feel more focused and creative in winter months.</p>
  <p><strong>Connection to CS:</strong> Programming is like winter — quiet, focused, and reflective. It's a time where you’re solving problems internally and creating in silence.</p>

  <h2>💰 Value of Money</h2>
  <p>Money represents freedom and opportunity to me. I’m interested in how financial systems work and how tech shapes banking and investing.</p>
  <p><strong>Connection to CS:</strong> FinTech is changing the world — from blockchain to mobile payments. My interest in money connects directly to programming for finance and secure transactions.</p>

  <h2>🍔 Food Lover</h2>
  <p>I enjoy food — trying new flavors and learning about cultures through cuisine. Cooking is both an art and a science, much like programming.</p>
  <p><strong>Connection to CS:</strong> Programming is like following a recipe — each step must be precise. It’s also creative, allowing you to “taste” the results and improve.</p>
  <p><strong>Related Computer Scientist:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Easley" target="_blank">Annie Easley</a> – A problem solver who broke barriers and believed in diversity, much like the variety found in food and culture.</p>

  <h2>👕 Clothing Style</h2>
  <p>I express myself through fashion — what I wear reflects my mood, creativity, and culture. I like staying on trend but adding my own twist.</p>
  <p><strong>Connection to CS:</strong> Like style, coding has trends, frameworks, and personal choices. Good design (in fashion or UI) comes from balancing function and expression.</p>
